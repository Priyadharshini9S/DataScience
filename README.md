==> Project Background

SpaceX is the most successful company of the commercial space 
age, making space travel affordable. The company advertises Falcon 
9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; 
other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the 
savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we 
can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost 
of a launch. Based on public information and machine learning 
models, we are going to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

==> Methodology
  1. Data collection methodology
  - Using SpaceX Rest API
  - Using Web Scrapping from Wikipedia
  2. Performed data wrangling
  - Filtering the data
  - Dealing with missing values
  - Using One Hot Encoding to prepare the data to a binary classification
  3. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL
  4. Performed interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
  5. Performed predictive analysis using classification models
  - Building, tuning and evaluation of classification models to ensure the best
  results
